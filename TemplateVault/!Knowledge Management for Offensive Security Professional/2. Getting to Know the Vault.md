# 2. Getting to Know the Vault

In my *note-organizing system*, I use a structured approach with folders to manage categorization effectively:

## 2.1. Organizational Folders

First, we have **Organizational Folders**:

1. **01 - Topics:** This folder is designated for *major categories/topics* that are pertinent to my field of work, such as "pentesting," "red team," "programming," and "networking." These categories broadly *define the subjects of all notes in my vault*. For quick recognition, notes within this folder start with the prefix `01 -`.

```ad-example

The following example comes from my personal vault
___

```

2. **02 - Types:** This folder is organized by the *nature or purpose of the content*, including classifications like "cheat sheets," "documentation," "techniques," and "write-ups." This categorization not only aids in *distinguishing between different types of notes* but also in *choosing the appropriate template for each*, ensuring consistency. Notes here are marked with a `02 -` prefix, reflecting their organizational function.

```ad-example

The following example comes from my personal vault
___

```

## 2.2. Content Folder

The main bulk of my notes resides in the **Content Folder**:

- **03 - Content:** This folder contains all the types of notes mentioned above and is where most of the work happens. Here, the naming convention for notes is more flexible.

While the Zettelkasten method typically advises against folder hierarchies, I find that a single folder for each note type aids significantly in manual searches for specific notes (e.g., finding a *cheat sheet* on Active Directory without sifting through unrelated documentation).

> Additionally, I maintain a *temporary folder* within the contents folder for current certification materials, streamlining study and review. Once the certification/course is completed, I move these notes into their respective folders.

```ad-example

The following example comes from my personal vault
___

```

## 2.3. Tasks Folder

As proficiency grows, so does the number of tasks, ideas, and to-dos. To keep track of these, I've dedicated a **Tasks Folder**:

- **04 - Tasks:** This folder includes *Kanban cards*[^1], a methodological tool used by development teams for *workflow management*. These cards are useful for listing tasks that advance you toward your goals. The naming convention here is also flexible.

> I also add "*Canvas Notes*"[^2] within this folder for capturing sudden but brilliant ideas, ensuring they're not forgotten and complex diagrams.

```ad-example
title: Tasks Example

The following example comes from my personal vault.
___
![[04_Tasks.png]]
```

```ad-seealso

## 2.4. Templates Folder

One reason I'm particularly fond of Obsidian is its *support for extensive plugins, customization options, and the ability to create personal templates*. To manage special template notes I use the **Templates Folder**:

- **05 - Templates:** Serves as a *container for various templates*, used to automate the process of creating a new note. These templates are prefaced with numbers.

Contained within this folder is a *templater script*[^3] ("Note Generator") activated upon creating a note, which facilitates the selection of the necessary structure, greatly enhancing productivity by eliminating decision-making for each new note.

```ad-example
title: Templates Folder Example

The following example comes from my personal vault
___
![[2_1_Organizational_Folders_Types.png]]
```

This folder also includes a *sub-folder* with *basic structural elements* common across different notes, utilized by the Note Generator script, following a sequential numbering system for easy reference.

```ad-example
title: Structural Elements Sub-folder Example

![[2_1_Organizational_Folders_Types.png]]
```

This customized structure accommodates my workflow, emphasizing efficiency and organization, and *can be modified to fit different individual preferences*.

## 2.5. Attachments Folder

Whenever a screenshot or media file is added to my vault, it's automatically stored in the **Attachments Folder**:

- **Attachments**: This folder *consolidates all media and attachments* in one location. You can set this folder as the default location for media storage by selecting it in the settings menu under *Files and Links*.

```ad-example
title: Attachments Folder Example

The following example comes from this template vault
___
![[2_5_Attachments.png]]
```

## 2.6. Miscellaneous Folders

While we've covered the essential folders necessary for your vault's functionality, *there's room for additional, optional folders based on your personal needs or preferences*. These folders can be tailored to accommodate any specific requirements or extra documents you wish to include, providing further customization and flexibility in managing your knowledge resources.

This organizational system is tailored to my preferences and has proven scalable and intuitive for my note-taking process. However, you should *adopt or adapt the organizational strategy to best suits your needs*.
