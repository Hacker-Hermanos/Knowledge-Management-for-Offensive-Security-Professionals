# 7. Note Formatting

As your note repository grows, it is essential to maintain a consistent style throughout all your notes. This makes referencing older notes easier, as you already know where to find the information without having to read the entire note.

In this section, my aim is to teach you how to keep your vault consistent while saving tons of time and adding longevity to your notes.

## 7.1 Plugins Needed for This Methodology

For this methodology, you will need the following plugin(s):

1. **Auto Link Title**: [Auto Link Title](https://github.com/zolrath/obsidian-auto-link-title) automatically grabs a URL's title from the website's HTML title upon pasting it in your note. It can also scan your note for bare URLs and rename them appropriately. This is a big time saver.
2. **Footnote Shortcut**: [Footnote Shortcut](https://github.com/akaalias/obsidian-footnotes) automates part of the footnote creation process. This is very useful if you prefer to cite your sources using footnotes instead of a dedicated "Resources" section. It can also be helpful if you are working on your own content and would like to add footnotes for citation purposes without using your mouse. I have used this plugin extensively during the creation of this course.
3. **Linter**: [Linter](https://github.com/platers/obsidian-linter) is a formatting plugin which I mentioned in the [[6. Metadata]] section of this course. It has a feature that scans your notes and is capable of fixing whitespace issues, metadata, and style discrepancies. It is a game-changer plugin that you will use every day.
4. **Markmind**: [Markmind](https://www.markmind.net/) enables you to create special mindmap notes without leaving Obsidian. This is useful for instances where you need to write a mindmap to visualize concepts.
5. **Note Refactor**: [Note Refactor](https://github.com/lynchjames/note-refactor-obsidian) can be used to split a long note into several atomic notes. This is very useful because having long notes with more than one topic can make them harder to read and reference.
6. **Table of Contents**: [Table of Contents](https://github.com/hipstersmoothie/obsidian-plugin-toc) scans your note and creates a table of contents. This is very useful for reports, which are notes that have to be long. I usually create a table of contents whenever I write exam reports to make it easier for the reader.
7. **Various Complements**: [Various Complements](https://tadashi-aikawa.github.io/docs-obsidian-various-complements-plugin/) has a ton of features, as its name implies. The reason I use it myself is for its auto-correct feature, which resembles that of an [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). Sometimes when writing notes, you will find yourself writing long and complex names, and this plugin will automatically create suggestions. It also features syntax highlighting, which is very useful for keeping your spelling in check.

## 7.2 How to Implement This Methodology

Start by installing each of these plugins from the Community Plugins tab.

![[Pasted image 20240630154701.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154730.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154800.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154813.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154826.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154836.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154847.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240630154859.png]]

### 7.2.1 Auto Link Title Setup

Remember that you can change the settings for each plugin by opening the settings window and going to the Community Plugins section on the left.

These are my settings:

![[Pasted image 20240630155222.png]]

*Enhance Default Paste* and *Enhance Drop Events* will make a request to the URL you are pasting and fetch the HTML title. This title is then used to rename the link using markdown syntax "`[]()`".

### 7.2.2 Footnote Shortcut

These are my settings:

![[Pasted image 20240630155545.png]]

I turned *Enable Footnote Section Heading* on, this will create a new section at the bottom of your note containing all your footnotes. This is optional but I personally like being able to see and click my "References" section at the bottom of my note outline.

You can use whatever name you like for the *Footnote Section Heading* option.

#### 7.2.2.1 Footnote Hotkeys

Before moving on, you should customize hotkeys for using this plugin. Open up the Settings Window and go to Options > Hotkeys; write "footnote" on the search bar.

![[Pasted image 20240630160046.png]]

In my case I have `Alt + 0` to insert an auto-numbered footnote and `Alt + -` to insert a named footnote.

After setting this plugin up, try using the shortcut in a new note.

Write a sentence and try inserting an auto-numbered footnote with `Alt + 0`. Doing this will create a footnote link in your sentence and automatically place your cursor on the automatically created footnote section. Enter the URL link there, Auto Link Title will take care of the URL name and by hitting Alt + 0, you will be taken back to the original text.

> This methodology is a huge time saver since you don't have to worry about creating the footnote link using `[^1]` scrolling down to the bottom, creating a new section, creating the actual footnote and scrolling back.

### 7.2.3 Linter

Because this plugin is designed to format your notes according to your preferred style settings, I suggest configuring it to match your personal preferences. This setup should take about 5 minutes and will yield results tailored to your liking. However, if you prefer, you can use my personal settings. To do so, open the settings window, navigate to *Community Plugins*, and select *Linter*.

### 7.2.4 Local Images

Here are my settings:

![[Pasted image 20240630155911.png]]

I have the *On Paste Processing* setting enabled because I want this plugin to work automatically whenever I paste an image from the Internet.

Set the *Media Folder* to your desired attachments folder. For this course, we are using "Attachments," as explained in [[2. Getting to Know the Vault]]. Any image URL will automatically download the image and save it to that folder.

![[Pasted image 20240630161126.png]]

### 7.2.5 Markmind

I have not customized the settings for this plugin and don't use it much nowadays. I prefer using Obsidian's built-in canvas feature because it is more intuitive. However, I know that several people prefer using mindmaps for their methodology, which is why I included it here.

Once installed, you can create a mindmap by opening the command palette (`Cmd + P` or `Ctrl + P`) and selecting the *Create New Mindmap* option.

![[Pasted image 20240630161944.png]]

I suggest reading the [official documentation](https://www.markmind.net/) for more detailed instructions, as the plugin offers many options and can become quite complex. Again, in my opinion, Obsidian's canvas is a superior option, and I will demonstrate how I use it in my daily workflow in a subsequent section.

The following picture is an example from a long time ago when I was experimenting using mindmaps for tracking my progress on my first Hack the Box machines.

![[Pasted image 20240702155743.png]]

### 7.2.6 Note Refactor

These are my settings:

![[Pasted image 20240630162425.png]]

This plugin is particularly useful for splitting monolithic or very long notes into multiple single-concept linked notes.

#### 7.2.6.1 Refactoring a Monolithic Note Example

Some time ago, when I was experimenting with my note-taking methodology, I created a very long cheatsheet note compiling commands needed for pentesting an Active Directory environment. This note was extremely difficult to navigate, and I often forgot which concepts were included.

In this section, I will teach you how I would tackle splitting massive notes into modular notes.

> The cheatsheets used in this example comes from [S1ckB0y1337's Active Directory cheatsheet](https://github.com/S1ckB0y1337/Active-Directory-Exploitation-Cheat-Sheet).
> You can review the example notes I made for this section: [[Active Directory Penetration Testing Methodology Cheatsheet]] [[ADPT Discovery]]

Here is a picture of the note's outline (it continues further down):

![[Pasted image 20240702125928.png]]

Clearly, this way of taking notes is inefficient and does not foster collaboration. Imagine having to sift through a note like this from a colleague to find information.

You might already have a note that looks similar. You will now learn how to convert it into a more usable format.

#### 7.2.6.2 Reviewing the Note

Start by identifying the various concepts discussed in the note.

![[Pasted image 20240702130558.png]]

First, we could use a more accurate title. Since we are performing more than just exploitation, we could rename the note to *Active Directory Penetration Testing Methodology Cheatsheet*.

![[Pasted image 20240702130813.png]]

The note's section titles are not as precise as they could be. Since the original note will serve as a wrapper containing the other notes, I will use a prefix (ADPT) to identify the other notes as children of this one.

![[Pasted image 20240702131350.png]]

#### 7.2.6.3 Refactoring the Note

Now copy and paste the title of the first heading, "ADPT Discovery," and hit `Cmd + N` or `Ctrl + N` to create a new note. Paste the title into the Note Title prompt.

![[Pasted image 20240702131746.png]]

Select "Cheatsheet" note from the Note Type prompt.

![[Pasted image 20240702131814.png]]

Now we have a note dedicated to "Discovery".

![[Pasted image 20240702131900.png]]

Fill in the metadata before proceeding with the note:

- Feel free to use the same *Note Types* from the parent note (Pentesting and Red Team).
- Proceed to lint the file using your hotkey (mine is `Cmd + Alt + L`) or the command palette (`Cmd + P` or `Ctrl + P`), and choose "Lint the current file." This will take care of the date and any style inconsistencies.
- Add the corresponding tags. In this case, I am using "activedirectory" and "discovery."

![[Pasted image 20240702133334.png]]

> Note that the word "Discovery" comes from the [MITRE ATT&CK Matrix for Enterprise](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/), which categorizes hacking techniques used in Penetration Tests and Red Team engagements. It is common for hacking certifications and training programs to use the word "Enumeration" instead of "Discovery." They also commonly mix "Lateral Movement" techniques with "Credential Access" techniques. I like to keep my notes as accurate as possible and use this Matrix as my compass.

Then proceed by filling in the Objective and Abstract [callouts](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Callouts) with simple descriptions so anyone glancing over this note in the future (including yourself) can understand what it contains without wasting too much time.

![[Pasted image 20240702132614.png]]

Proceed to the "MITRE Tactics" section and remove any techniques that are not relevant to the topic at hand. In this case, we are only keeping "Discovery." You can remove multiple rows using your mouse by clicking and dragging or using your keyboard's Shift and arrow keys.

![[Pasted image 20240702133535.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240702133545.png]]

At this point, I would fill in the "Resources" section.

- This is optional, but you could create an admonition list using all notes related to "Active Directory" and "Discovery."
- In the future, if I stumble upon a blog post containing new discovery techniques, I could add it to the resources table with a short description.

![[Pasted image 20240702134455.png]]

Now I will go to the parent note and right-click the "ADPT Discovery" heading.

The last option shown in the menu is from the Note Refactor plugin and allows you to extract the heading and move it to a new existing note (If there is no existing note, it will create one for you with that name).

![[Pasted image 20240702134811.png]]

After clicking "Extract this heading...", you will see a prompt asking which note to append this heading to. Since I already have a note with the same name as the heading, the program detects it and lets me choose it.

![[Pasted image 20240702134917.png]]

As you can see, the heading disappears from the parent note ([[Active Directory Penetration Testing Methodology Cheatsheet]]), leaving us with a link to the child note ([[ADPT Discovery]]). The original heading `## ADPT Discovery` is then appended to the child note.

![[Pasted image 20240702135053.png]]

Now we can fill the "Examples" section of the child note using the "ADPT Discovery" heading's subsections.

![[Pasted image 20240702135203.png]]**

You can cut and paste these level 3 headings into the "Examples" section.

![[Pasted image 20240702135251.png]]

At this point, you could select the whole subsection's contents and create a new "ad-example" type admonition callout to contain it. You can set a hotkey for *Insert Admonition* by going to the Settings window under Hotkeys. I use `Cmd + Shift + A` or `Ctrl + Shift + A`.

In this case, I won't be using the *Insert Admonition* command because it uses three backticks to create the block, and this section contains various triple backtick code blocks. This is a common issue, and to solve it, we can leverage triple wave dashes `~` or more than three backticks.

Select the whole section, leaving a blank newline both above and below.

![[Pasted image 20240702140310.png]]
![[Pasted image 20240702140328.png]]

Then input three wave dashes `~`. As you can see, the whole section is now contained within the wave dashes as a code block.

![[Pasted image 20240702140431.png]]

> If I used the Insert Codeblock command, the block would not work as intended.

Then you can add `ad-example` as the codeblock type. This will encapsulate the whole codeblock within an "example" admonition callout when previewing the note. Finally, add a title, such as "AD Discovery Using Powerview."

![[Pasted image 20240702140758.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240702140706.png]]

I then performed the same callout encapsulation on the remaining "Examples" subheadings.

Going back to the parent note, rinse and repeat the whole process for each remaining heading.

![[Pasted image 20240702141357.png]]

> This refactoring process can be somewhat tedious, but it will pay off later when you are referencing a technique during practice or a challenging exam, and every concept is logically organized with commands ready to be copied and pasted. Also, remember that if you are already using a parent note to encompass all child concepts, you won't have to do this whole refactoring process ever again.

#### 7.2.6.4 Finishing the Parent Note

Going back to the parent note, we are left with an awkward structure that we will want to fix.

![[Pasted image 20240702141506.png]]

Move your cursor to a blank space right after the main heading (as shown in the previous picture), and open up the command palette (`Cmd + P` or `Ctrl + P`). Select "Open Insert Template Modal" from Templater.

![[Pasted image 20240702142042.png]]

Choose the Note Generator.

![[Pasted image 20240702142102.png]]

Then choose the corresponding note type (Cheatsheet in this case).

![[Pasted image 20240702142134.png]]

This will generate and insert a cheatsheet note into the current note.

![[Pasted image 20240702142319.png]]

Remove the metadata section that got generated, lint the file (`Cmd + Alt + L` or `Ctrl + Alt + L`), and you are left with a new cheatsheet note.

![[Pasted image 20240702142801.png]]

At this point, I would remove all sections, leaving only the "Objective" and "Resources" sections.

Fill in the "Objective" section.

![[Pasted image 20240702142923.png]]

Move the children note's links to the Resources section.

#### 7.2.6.5 Final Result

My final parent note looks like this:

![[Pasted image 20240702143110.png]]

Opening the parent/wrapper note (left) and children note (right):

![[Pasted image 20240702143209.png]]

In my cheatsheets folder:

![[Pasted image 20240702143655.png]]

> This configuration mimics the way official documentation is presented on the internet.

If we go to Active Directory's documentation by Microsoft, we can see a similar structure. On this documentation page, they give an overview of what ADDS is and then provide a few links below so you can learn more about different topics.

![[Pasted image 20240702143448.png]]

### 7.2.7 Table of Contents

This plugin is very useful if you want to extract a note as a PDF for a report or if you simply want to add a table of contents to your finished note. These are my settings:

![[Pasted image 20240702145218.png]]

- List Style is bugged and only Bullet is available. When rendering, it will use a numbered list.
- Title is "## Table of Contents".
- Minimum Header Depth is 2.

> I suggest using your own preferred settings for this plugin. Experiment by tweaking Maximum and Minimum header depths.

#### 7.2.7.1 Example Table of Contents

I will showcase an example using the "ADPT Discovery" note from the Note Refactor section.

Say I want to extract this note into a PDF format. I would go to the line after the only level 1 heading, the main heading (containing the note's title and all content below).

![[Pasted image 20240702144835.png]]

Open up the command palette and select *Create table of contents*:

![[Pasted image 20240702144900.png]]

As you can see, a table of contents section gets generated:

![[Pasted image 20240702145249.png]]

The numbers look wrong, but if we change to preview mode (`Cmd + E` or `Ctrl + E`), the numbers are displayed correctly.

> You can also change the display mode by clicking on the display mode icon in the status bar.

![[Pasted image 20240702145529.png]]

Reading mode representation:

![[Pasted image 20240702145427.png]]

The table of contents' links also work after exporting the note as a PDF:

Open up the command palette (`Cmd + P` or `Ctrl + P`) and select *Export to PDF*.

![[Pasted image 20240702145807.png]]

![[Pasted image 20240702145826.png]]

Final PDF note:

![[Pasted image 20240702150125.png]]

This is a very useful trick I use when converting markdown reports to PDF for certification exams.

> **Note**: I have found multiple bugs when using this plugin: TOC links do not work after rendering the PDF version, and the numbers in subsections are not displayed correctly when working in Live Preview mode from Obsidian.

### 7.2.8 Various Complements

My settings are left as default, but I suggest going through this plugin's settings in case there is something you need to tweak.

If you spell something wrong while working in Obsidian, the plugin will highlight that word. Then you can right-click the word and either add it to the dictionary or correct it using a suggestion.

![[Pasted image 20240702150856.png]]

By default, syntax highlighting is off when the word is inside a code block.

![[Pasted image 20240702151143.png]]

Another useful feature this plugin boasts is autocomplete suggestions as you type.

![[Pasted image 20240702151207.png]]

> As you can see, I use this plugin for those two settings exclusively. Feel free to experiment with the settings and let us know if you find any other cool tricks.
